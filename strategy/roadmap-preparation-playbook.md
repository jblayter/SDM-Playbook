# Roadmap Preparation Playbook

**Purpose:**  
Provide a comprehensive, repeatable process for preparing engineering inputs to product roadmaps. This ensures technical priorities, risks, team development, and realities are represented alongside business goals, so the final roadmap is balanced, achievable, and sustainable.

## 1. Why It Matters
- Roadmaps are not just product's domain — they are cross-functional.  
- Without engineering input, technical debt, scalability needs, and risks can be overlooked.  
- Preparation builds trust with your product counterpart and creates alignment across stakeholders.  
- Team growth and development opportunities must be woven into technical work.
- Resource planning and budget considerations directly impact roadmap feasibility.

## 2. Preparation Steps for SDMs

### Gather Inputs
- **Company/Business Goals:** Review OKRs, strategy docs, and leadership priorities.  
- **Product Direction:** Understand product's vision and desired customer outcomes.  
- **Engineering Health:** Summarize tech debt, infra upgrades, reliability needs, and velocity trends.  
- **Team Capacity:** Evaluate realistic delivery potential given headcount and skills.  
- **Dependencies:** Capture cross-team or vendor dependencies that influence timing.  
- **Team Growth Needs:** Map individual development goals to technical projects and learning opportunities.
- **Resource Requirements:** Assess budget, headcount, tooling, and infrastructure needs.
- **Stakeholder Landscape:** Identify all stakeholders and their communication preferences.

### Analyze and Frame
- **Translate Technical Needs into Business Terms:**  
  Example: "Upgrade CI pipeline > reduces release time by 30% > faster time-to-market for features."  
- **Identify Risks:** Note where lack of investment could create outages, bottlenecks, or churn.  
- **Propose Trade-Offs:** Suggest where to defer, simplify, or re-sequence based on business priorities.  
- **Map Team Development:** Connect technical initiatives to individual growth opportunities.
- **Assess Resource Impact:** Quantify budget and headcount implications of each initiative.

### Align with Product
- Share a **pre-read** summary with product before roadmap workshops.  
- Focus on framing engineering needs as enablers of product goals, not competing items.  
- Come prepared with **data** (velocity, incident trends, infra costs) to support recommendations.  
- Present team development opportunities as value-adds, not overhead.

- **[Execution Tracking System](./execution-tracking-system.md)** - Post-roadmap monitoring and adaptation

## 6. Success Metrics
Engineering needs are consistently represented in the roadmap. Product partners trust engineering input, and the resulting roadmap balances **features, tech investment, team development, and risk management** in a way the team can deliver sustainably while growing professionally.

### Leading Indicators
- Stakeholder alignment on technical priorities
- Team engagement and development opportunities
- Clear resource allocation and budget approval
- Cross-team coordination effectiveness

### Lagging Indicators
- On-time delivery of technical initiatives
- Team skill development and career progression
- Reduced technical debt and improved system reliability
- Business goal achievement through technical enablement
