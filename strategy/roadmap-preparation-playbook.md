# Roadmap Preparation Playbook

**Purpose:**  
Provide a comprehensive, repeatable process for preparing engineering inputs to product roadmaps. This ensures technical priorities, risks, team development, and realities are represented alongside business goals, so the final roadmap is balanced, achievable, and sustainable.

**Servant Leadership Philosophy:**  
This playbook is designed with the understanding that great roadmaps emerge from serving your team's growth, understanding stakeholder needs, and creating psychological safety for honest conversations about capacity, constraints, and aspirations.

**Progress Over Process:**  
This guide prioritizes outcomes over checklists. Use these frameworks as tools to accelerate progress, not as bureaucratic requirements. The goal is to deliver better roadmaps faster, not to complete every item on every list. Adapt, simplify, and focus on what creates the most value for your team and stakeholders.

**Bias for Action:**  
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. Start with the Essential 3, make decisions quickly, and iterate based on results.

## Quick Start Guide (30 Minutes to Better Roadmaps)

**If you have 30 minutes:**
1. **Talk to your team** (15 min) - "What's our biggest constraint right now? What would help you grow?"
2. **Talk to product** (15 min) - "What's your biggest pressure? How can engineering help you succeed?"

**If you have 1 hour:**
3. **Review tech health** (15 min) - What's our biggest technical risk?
4. **Map key dependencies** (15 min) - What do we need from others? What do others need from us?
5. **Draft 3 key initiatives** (15 min) - Technical work that enables product goals
6. **Share with stakeholders** (15 min) - Get feedback and alignment

**If you have 2+ hours:**
7. Use the detailed frameworks below to create comprehensive roadmaps

## 1. Why It Matters
- Roadmaps are not just product's domain â€” they are cross-functional.  
- Without engineering input, technical debt, scalability needs, and risks can be overlooked.  
- Preparation builds trust with your product counterpart and creates alignment across stakeholders.  
- Team growth and development opportunities must be woven into technical work.
- Resource planning and budget considerations directly impact roadmap feasibility.
- **Most importantly:** Roadmaps should reflect the human reality of your team's capacity, aspirations, and well-being, not just business objectives.

## 2. Progress-First Framework (The 80/20 Approach)

### The Essential 3 (Do These First)
1. **Team Reality Check** - 15 minutes with each team member to understand current capacity, aspirations, and constraints
2. **Stakeholder Alignment** - 30-minute conversation with product to understand their priorities and pressures  
3. **Technical Health Assessment** - Quick review of critical tech debt, risks, and growth opportunities

### The Value-Add 3 (If Time Allows)
4. **Resource Planning** - Rough budget and headcount needs for key initiatives
5. **Dependency Mapping** - Identify critical cross-team dependencies and risks
6. **Success Metrics** - Define how you'll measure progress and success

### The "Nice to Have" 3 (Only If Critical)
7. **Detailed Risk Analysis** - For high-stakes initiatives only
8. **Comprehensive Stakeholder Mapping** - For complex multi-team initiatives
9. **Formal Documentation** - Only if required by your organization

**Key Principle:** Start with the Essential 3. Add more only if it directly contributes to better outcomes or prevents significant risks.

### Progress Acceleration Tips
- **Time-box everything** - Set strict time limits for each activity to avoid analysis paralysis
- **Start with conversations, not documents** - Human connection creates better outcomes than perfect documentation
- **Focus on the "why" not the "what"** - Understanding motivations drives better decisions than detailed requirements
- **Embrace "good enough"** - A 70% solution delivered on time beats a 100% solution delivered late
- **Bias for action** - Most decisions are reversible, so make them quickly and iterate based on results
- **Iterate and improve** - Use each roadmap cycle to refine your approach, not to add more process

## 3. Detailed Preparation Steps (When You Need Them)

### Gather Inputs
- **Company/Business Goals:** Review OKRs, strategy docs, and leadership priorities.  
- **Product Direction:** Understand product's vision and desired customer outcomes.  
- **Engineering Health:** Summarize tech debt, infra upgrades, reliability needs, and velocity trends.  
- **Team Capacity:** Evaluate realistic delivery potential given headcount and skills.  
- **Dependencies:** Capture cross-team or vendor dependencies that influence timing.  
- **Team Growth Needs:** Map individual development goals to technical projects and learning opportunities.
- **Resource Requirements:** Assess budget, headcount, tooling, and infrastructure needs.
- **Stakeholder Landscape:** Identify all stakeholders and their communication preferences.
- **Team Well-being:** Assess current stress levels, work-life balance, and psychological safety.
- **Individual Aspirations:** Understand each team member's career goals and personal motivations.

### Analyze and Frame
- **Translate Technical Needs into Business Terms:**  
  Example: "Upgrade CI pipeline > reduces release time by 30% > faster time-to-market for features."  
- **Identify Risks:** Note where lack of investment could create outages, bottlenecks, or churn.  
- **Propose Trade-Offs:** Suggest where to defer, simplify, or re-sequence based on business priorities.  
- **Map Team Development:** Connect technical initiatives to individual growth opportunities.
- **Assess Resource Impact:** Quantify budget and headcount implications of each initiative.
- **Consider Human Impact:** Evaluate how each initiative affects team morale, learning, and career growth.
- **Balance Ambition with Sustainability:** Ensure the roadmap challenges the team without overwhelming them.

### Align with Product
- Share a **pre-read** summary with product before roadmap workshops.  
- Focus on framing engineering needs as enablers of product goals, not competing items.  
- Come prepared with **data** (velocity, incident trends, infra costs) to support recommendations.  
- Present team development opportunities as value-adds, not overhead.
- **Listen with Empathy:** Understand product's pressures and constraints before presenting engineering needs.
- **Build Shared Understanding:** Create psychological safety for honest conversations about trade-offs and constraints.

### The Real Success Metrics
**Progress Indicators (What Actually Matters):**
- **Team velocity and quality** - Are we delivering more value with less stress?
- **Stakeholder satisfaction** - Do product and leadership trust our input and delivery?
- **Team growth and retention** - Are people advancing their careers and staying engaged?
- **Technical health** - Are we reducing debt and improving reliability over time?
- **Business impact** - Are our technical initiatives enabling product success?

### Process Efficiency Metrics (How Well We Work)
- **Time to roadmap completion** - How quickly can we create aligned roadmaps?
- **Stakeholder alignment speed** - How fast do we reach consensus on priorities?
- **Decision quality** - How often do we make the right trade-offs?
- **Team engagement** - How much do people enjoy the planning process?

### Anti-Metrics (What to Avoid)
- **Checklist completion rate** - Don't measure process completion
- **Documentation volume** - Don't measure output quantity
- **Meeting frequency** - Don't measure activity over outcomes
- **Template adherence** - Don't measure compliance over results

**Key Principle:** Measure progress, not process. Focus on outcomes that matter to your team and stakeholders.

## 7. Process Optimization (Continuous Improvement)

### Monthly Process Review
**Ask your team:**
- "What roadmap activities created the most value this month?"
- "What felt like busywork or bureaucracy?"
- "How can we make this faster and more effective?"

**Ask your stakeholders:**
- "What information do you actually need from engineering?"
- "What format would be most helpful for you?"
- "How can we make our collaboration more efficient?"

### Quarterly Process Evolution
- **Eliminate** - Remove activities that don't create value
- **Simplify** - Streamline processes that are too complex
- **Automate** - Use tools to reduce manual work
- **Focus** - Double down on activities that create the most impact

### Signs You're Over-Processed
- **Team complains** about too many meetings or documents
- **Stakeholders skip** your detailed updates
- **You spend more time** on process than on conversations
- **Decisions are delayed** by analysis paralysis
- **Team morale drops** during planning periods
- **You're waiting for perfect information** before making decisions
- **You're over-analyzing reversible decisions** instead of taking action

### Signs You're Under-Processed
- **Stakeholders are surprised** by technical constraints
- **Team feels unprepared** for roadmap discussions
- **Decisions are made** without sufficient context
- **Technical risks** are discovered too late
- **Team growth** isn't being considered in planning

**Remember:** The goal is to find the minimum viable process that creates maximum value. Less is often more.
