# Translating Company Vision into Technical Direction

**Purpose:**  
Bridge the gap between abstract company strategy and concrete engineering work. This ensures the team’s daily activities align with long-term business goals, making the vision actionable and measurable.

## 1. Why It Matters
- Engineers need clarity on how their work ties to the bigger picture.  
- Leadership needs confidence that technical decisions support strategic goals.  
- Misalignment creates wasted effort, duplicated work, and morale issues.  

By making the abstract concrete, an SDM empowers the team to make decisions in context, not just follow tickets.

## 2. Key Steps in Translation

### Understand the Vision
- Study the company mission, OKRs, and leadership priorities.  
- Identify themes (growth, reliability, efficiency, customer satisfaction).  

### Clarifying Questions to Translate Vision into Technical Direction

#### Outcome
1. What specific business outcome are we trying to achieve with this initiative?  
2. How will we know if we’ve succeeded, what’s the measurable indicator?  
3. If we could only achieve one outcome from this vision, what would it be?  
4. What is the minimum viable outcome that still delivers value?  

#### Alignment
5. Who is the primary customer or stakeholder for this vision?  
6. Which company OKRs or strategic priorities does this map to?  
7. What is the timeline expectation, near-term impact or long-term investment?  
8. Who else (teams, departments, vendors) needs to be aligned for this to work?  
9. What trade-offs are acceptable, speed vs. quality, scope vs. cost, short-term vs. long-term?  
10. How does this initiative support or compete with other priorities?  

#### Risk
11. What would happen if we did nothing, what’s the cost of inaction?  
12. What assumptions are we making that could be wrong?  
13. What are the biggest risks if we take this path?  
14. What are the dependencies that could impact success?  
15. How does this initiative position us for future opportunities or challenges?  

#### Value
16. What problem are we solving for the business or customer?  
17. How will this initiative change the customer’s experience?  

#### Context
18. Is this about growth, efficiency, reliability, customer trust, or something else?  
19. How should we balance this against technical debt and operational health?  
20. What data or evidence do we already have to support this direction?  

### Define Technical Outcomes
- Map vision themes to engineering focus areas.  
  - Example: "Increase market share" > scale onboarding systems to handle 3× users.  
  - Example: "Improve customer trust" > reduce incidents and add observability.  

### Break Down into Initiatives
- Create clear initiatives that link vision > outcome > technical work.  
- Use a one-liner format: *"To achieve X business goal, we will do Y technical initiative, which delivers Z outcome."*  

### Prioritize & Sequence
- Weigh initiatives against business impact, technical feasibility, and urgency.  
- Use frameworks like RICE or WSJF for alignment with product.  

### Communicate Back
- Present initiatives in both business and technical terms.  
- Keep messaging consistent across audiences: executives, peers, engineers.  

## 3. Example Translation
**Company Vision:** Become the most reliable platform for small businesses.  
**Technical Direction:**  
- Initiative 1: Build auto-scaling infrastructure to handle peak loads (supports reliability).  
- Initiative 2: Introduce automated testing pipeline to reduce escaped defects (supports trust).  
- Initiative 3: Implement audit logging for compliance (supports credibility with enterprise).  

## 4. Continuous Alignment
- Revisit alignment quarterly — vision evolves, and technical direction must follow.  
- Encourage engineers to connect ideas upward: *"This optimization supports our reliability goal."*  
- Maintain a decision log of how technical choices map back to strategy.  

## 5. Ritual Cadence
- **Quarterly:** Translate updated company OKRs into technical initiatives.  
- **Monthly:** Review progress with product/leadership to ensure alignment.  
- **Sprintly:** Connect backlog items to higher-level initiatives in planning.  

## Success Metric
Engineering initiatives are directly traceable to company strategy. Both leadership and engineers can articulate the connection between vision, direction, and daily work.
