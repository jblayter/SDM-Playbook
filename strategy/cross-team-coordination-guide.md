# Cross-Team Coordination Guide

**Purpose:**  
Provide a comprehensive framework for managing dependencies, coordination, and collaboration across multiple engineering teams, ensuring effective cross-functional delivery and alignment.

## 1. Coordination Types

### Horizontal Coordination (Peer Teams)
- **Product Teams:** Different product areas or features
- **Platform Teams:** Shared services, infrastructure, tooling
- **Specialist Teams:** Security, DevOps, Data, Mobile
- **Support Teams:** QA, Documentation, Technical Writing

### Vertical Coordination (Dependency Chains)
- **Upstream Dependencies:** Teams that provide services to you
- **Downstream Dependencies:** Teams that consume your services
- **Shared Dependencies:** Common services, tools, or resources
- **External Dependencies:** Vendors, partners, third-party services

### Cross-Functional Coordination
- **Product Management:** Feature requirements and prioritization
- **Design:** User experience and interface requirements
- **Marketing:** Go-to-market and launch coordination
- **Sales:** Customer requirements and feedback
- **Support:** Customer issues and feature requests

## 2. Dependency Mapping Framework

### Dependency Identification
1. **Service Dependencies:** APIs, shared services, data sources
2. **Resource Dependencies:** Shared infrastructure, tools, environments
3. **Timeline Dependencies:** Sequential work, handoff points, milestones
4. **Knowledge Dependencies:** Expertise, documentation, training
5. **Decision Dependencies:** Architecture choices, technology decisions

### Dependency Matrix Template
```
Team A → Team B Dependency:
- Type: [Service/Resource/Timeline/Knowledge/Decision]
- Description: [What Team A needs from Team B]
- Timeline: [When needed vs when available]
- Owner: [Person responsible for coordination]
- Status: [Planned/In Progress/Complete/Blocked]
- Risk Level: [High/Medium/Low]
```

### Dependency Visualization
```
Dependency Map - [Initiative]

Team A (Your Team)
    ↓ (needs API changes)
Team B (Platform Team)
    ↓ (needs infrastructure)
Team C (DevOps Team)
    ↓ (needs security review)
Team D (Security Team)
```
