## 2. Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Identification Process
1. **Brainstorming Sessions:** Team and stakeholder risk identification
2. **Historical Analysis:** Review past incidents and failures
3. **External Research:** Industry trends and best practices
4. **Scenario Planning:** "What if" analysis for different situations
5. **Stakeholder Input:** Gather risk perspectives from all parties

### Risk Assessment Matrix
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Priority | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| [Risk] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [1-9] | High/Med/Low | [Person] |

**Risk Score Calculation:**
- High Probability + High Impact = 9 (Critical)
- High Probability + Medium Impact = 6 (High)
- Medium Probability + High Impact = 6 (High)
- Medium Probability + Medium Impact = 4 (Medium)
- Low Probability + High Impact = 3 (Medium)
- Low Probability + Medium Impact = 2 (Low)
- Low Probability + Low Impact = 1 (Low)

### Risk Register Template
```
Risk ID: [Unique Identifier]
Risk Name: [Descriptive Name]
Category: [Technical/Resource/Business/Operational]
Description: [Detailed description of the risk]
Probability: [High/Medium/Low]
Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
Risk Score: [1-9]
Owner: [Person responsible for managing this risk]

Last Updated: [Date]
```

## 3. Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk Mitigation Approaches
1. **Avoid:** Eliminate the risk entirely
2. **Mitigate:** Reduce probability or impact
3. **Transfer:** Move risk to another party (insurance, contracts)
4. **Accept:** Acknowledge and monitor the risk
5. **Contingency:** Prepare response plans for if risk occurs

```

### Risk Review Cadence
