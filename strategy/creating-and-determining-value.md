# Creating and Determining Value Playbook

**Purpose:**  
Help Software Development Managers consistently evaluate, create, and communicate value across customers, business, and engineering. This ensures that technical initiatives are tied directly to outcomes that matter.

## 1. Why Value Matters
- Aligns engineering effort with company strategy and customer needs.  
- Prevents wasted effort on low-impact features or infrastructure.  
- Builds trust with leadership and peers by showing engineering impact in business terms.  
- Provides clarity for the team on *why* their work is meaningful.

## 2. Dimensions of Value

### Customer Value
- Solves a real customer problem or removes friction.  
- Improves usability, speed, or reliability of the product.  
- Helps customers achieve their goals more effectively.  

### Business Value
- Increases revenue (new customers, upsells, retention).  
- Reduces cost (fewer manual processes, less support burden, infrastructure efficiency).  
- Strengthens market position (competitive differentiation, compliance, brand trust).  
- Aligns directly to company OKRs or strategic initiatives.  

### Engineering Value
- Improves reliability and reduces incidents.  
- Increases maintainability and reduces long-term technical debt.  
- Enables faster development velocity through better tooling, pipelines, or architecture.  
- Reduces systemic risks (security gaps, single points of failure).  

## 3. Framework for Determining Value
Ask clarifying questions across the three dimensions:

- **Customer:** Who benefits? What problem is solved? How will their experience improve?  
- **Business:** How does this tie to revenue, cost, or strategy? What is the cost of inaction?  
- **Engineering:** Does this make the system faster, safer, or easier to evolve?  

A strong initiative demonstrates value in **at least two dimensions**.

## 4. Steps to Create Value
1. **Understand the Vision**  
   - Tie initiatives back to company strategy and goals.  
   - Identify which customer problems matter most.  

2. **Define Outcomes**  
   - Express in measurable terms: adoption, revenue, performance improvement, risk reduction.  
   - Example: *"Reduce average support tickets by 20% in the next quarter."*  

3. **[Translate Into Initiatives](./translating-outcomes-into-initiatives.md)**  
   - Map the business or customer outcome into concrete technical actions.  
   - Example: *"Automated testing pipeline reduces defects â†’ lowers churn and support costs."*  

4. **Communicate Value Clearly**  
   - Frame in business terms: *"This reduces support costs by $50k per quarter."*  
   - Use trends, not just snapshots (e.g., defect rate trending down).  
   - Use [Engineering Health Report](../health/engineering-health-report.md) template to communicate value metrics.  

5. **Measure and Revisit**  
   - Define baseline metrics before the work begins.  
   - Track results regularly; adjust if impact is less than expected.  

## 5. Value Assessment Checklist
Use this before committing to any significant initiative:

- What customer problem does this solve?  
- How does this align with company OKRs?  
- What measurable outcome defines success?  
- What is the cost of inaction?  
- Does this improve our ability to deliver in the future?  
- Which stakeholders benefit, and can they articulate the value?  

## 6. Ritual Cadence
- **Sprintly:** Validate that backlog items link to value-driven initiatives.  
- **Monthly:** Review value delivered against outcomes with product/leadership.  
- **Quarterly:** Re-assess initiatives against evolving company vision and OKRs using [Quarterly Planning Alignment](../communication/07-quarterly-planning-alignment.md).  

## Success Metric
Engineering effort consistently produces visible improvements in customer satisfaction, business outcomes, and long-term technical health. Value is clearly articulated and measurable across all initiatives.
