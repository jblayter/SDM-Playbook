# Communicating Engineering Health

> “If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.” - Peter Drucker / GE leadership

**Purpose:**  
Provide visibility into the state of engineering work in terms that resonate with business leaders. Engineering health covers **velocity, quality, and risks**, and is expressed in outcomes, not just raw metrics.

## 1. Why It Matters
- Leaders need confidence that engineering is delivering predictably and sustainably.  
- Product partners need clarity to balance scope, timelines, and quality.  
- The team needs validation that their work is being recognized and connected to business outcomes.  

By communicating engineering health in **business terms**, we ensure trust, transparency, and alignment.

## 2. Core Dimensions of Engineering Health
### Velocity (Delivery Capacity)
- **Definition:** The pace at which the team can deliver value.  
- **Business framing:** *“Are we able to hit milestones predictably and respond to market needs?”*  
- **Signals:**  
  - Throughput (stories/features delivered per sprint)  
  - Cycle time / lead time trends  
  - Predictability of commitments vs. delivery  

### Quality (Stability & Maintainability)
- **Definition:** The ability to deliver changes reliably without degrading the system.  
- **Business framing:** *“Can we innovate quickly without creating future drag or customer pain?”*  
- **Signals:**  
  - Defect/incident rate  
  - Escaped bugs vs. caught in testing  
  - Tech debt backlog trend  
  - Customer support tickets related to engineering issues  

### Risks (Future-Proofing & Constraints)
- **Definition:** Potential issues that could slow or derail delivery in the future.  
- **Business framing:** *“Where are the hidden costs or risks that might jeopardize outcomes?”*  
- **Signals:**  
  - High-risk dependencies (3rd parties, infra bottlenecks)  
  - Overloaded key contributors (bus factor)  
  - Aging systems or modules without test coverage  
  - Known regulatory/compliance gaps  

## 3. Translating Metrics to Business Terms
| Engineering Metric         | Business Translation                               |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Cycle time up 30%          | Delivery speed slowing → slower time-to-market     |
| High bug reopen rate       | Quality issues → customer churn / support costs    |
| 70% of work is “firefighting” | Opportunity cost → fewer features for customers |
| Single engineer owns key system | Risk exposure → bottleneck / bus factor issue |

## 4. How to Communicate
- **Use Trends, Not Snapshots**  
  - Focus on directional movement (improving, stable, worsening).  
  - Example: *“Cycle time has improved 15% over 3 months, giving us more predictability.”*  

- **Tell Stories, Not Just Numbers**  
  - Tie metrics to customer/business impact.  
  - Example: *“We reduced support tickets by 20%, saving ~$50k/quarter in customer support hours.”*  

- **Show Trade-offs Transparently**  
  - Example: *“We can ship Feature A by end of Q2 if we defer Tech Debt B — but risk of outages will increase by 10%.”*  

## 5. Ritual Cadence
- **Weekly:** Brief status updates (velocity & blockers).  
- **Monthly:** Health snapshot (velocity, quality, risks).  
- **Quarterly:** Deep dive review with trends + systemic improvement plan.  

## 6. Example Communication Templates
**Weekly Exec Update (Slack/Email):**  
> Velocity: Team delivered 95% of sprint commitments (8 features shipped).  
> Quality: 3 incidents, all resolved within SLA. Tech debt ratio stable.  
> Risks: Dependency on vendor X remains — we're engaging procurement for alternatives.

**Use [Engineering Health Report](../communication-templates/03-engineering-health-report.md) template for structured reporting.**  

**Quarterly Review (Slide Summary):**  
- **Velocity:** On track with roadmap, cycle time improved 15% since last quarter.  
- **Quality:** Bug reopen rate down 10%, customer issues reduced.  
- **Risks:** Recruiting needed to reduce single-point dependency on payment service.  

## Success Metric
Engineering health is understood and trusted by leadership in **business terms** (time-to-market, cost, customer impact, risk), not just raw engineering data.
