# Translating Company Vision into Technical Direction

**Purpose:**  
Bridge the gap between abstract company strategy and concrete engineering work. This ensures the team's daily activities align with long-term business goals, making the vision actionable and measurable.

## 1. Why It Matters
- Engineers need clarity on how their work ties to the bigger picture.  
- Leadership needs confidence that technical decisions support strategic goals.  
- Misalignment creates wasted effort, duplicated work, and morale issues.  

By making the abstract concrete, an SDM empowers the team to make decisions in context, not just follow tickets.

## 2. Key Steps in Translation

### Understand the Vision
- Study the company mission, OKRs, and leadership priorities.  
- Identify themes (growth, reliability, efficiency, customer satisfaction).  

### Define Technical Outcomes
- Map vision themes to engineering focus areas.  
  - Example: "Increase market share" → scale onboarding systems to handle 3× users.  
  - Example: "Improve customer trust" → reduce incidents and add observability.  

### Break Down into Initiatives
- Create clear initiatives that link vision → outcome → technical work.  
- Use a one-liner format: *"To achieve X business goal, we will do Y technical initiative, which delivers Z outcome."*  

### Prioritize & Sequence
- Weigh initiatives against business impact, technical feasibility, and urgency.  
- Use frameworks like RICE or WSJF for alignment with product.  
- Reference [Creating and Determining Value](./creating-and-determining-value.md) for detailed prioritization frameworks.  

### Communicate Back
- Present initiatives in both business and technical terms.  
- Keep messaging consistent across audiences: executives, peers, engineers.  

## 3. Example Translation
**Company Vision:** Become the most reliable platform for small businesses.  
**Technical Direction:**  
- Initiative 1: Build auto-scaling infrastructure to handle peak loads (supports reliability).  
- Initiative 2: Introduce automated testing pipeline to reduce escaped defects (supports trust).  
- Initiative 3: Implement audit logging for compliance (supports credibility with enterprise).  

## 4. Continuous Alignment
- Revisit alignment quarterly — vision evolves, and technical direction must follow.  
- Encourage engineers to connect ideas upward: *"This optimization supports our reliability goal."*  
- Maintain a decision log of how technical choices map back to strategy.  

## 5. Ritual Cadence
- **Quarterly:** Translate updated company OKRs into technical initiatives using [Quarterly Planning Alignment](../communication/07-quarterly-planning-alignment.md).  
- **Monthly:** Review progress with product/leadership to ensure alignment.  
- **Sprintly:** Connect backlog items to higher-level initiatives in planning.  

## Success Metric
Engineering initiatives are directly traceable to company strategy. Both leadership and engineers can articulate the connection between vision, direction, and daily work.
