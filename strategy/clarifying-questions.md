# Clarifying Questions for Strategic Alignment

**Purpose:**  
Provide a comprehensive set of clarifying questions to help translate abstract company vision into concrete technical direction. These questions ensure alignment between business goals and engineering work.

## Outcome Questions
1. What specific business outcome are we trying to achieve with this initiative?  
2. How will we know if we've succeeded, what's the measurable indicator?  
3. If we could only achieve one outcome from this vision, what would it be?  
4. What is the minimum viable outcome that still delivers value?  

## Alignment Questions
5. Who is the primary customer or stakeholder for this vision?  
6. Which company OKRs or strategic priorities does this map to?  
7. What is the timeline expectation, near-term impact or long-term investment?  
8. Who else (teams, departments, vendors) needs to be aligned for this to work?  
9. What trade-offs are acceptable, speed vs. quality, scope vs. cost, short-term vs. long-term?  
10. How does this initiative support or compete with other priorities?  

## Risk Questions
11. What would happen if we did nothing, what's the cost of inaction?  
12. What assumptions are we making that could be wrong?  
13. What are the biggest risks if we take this path?  
14. What are the dependencies that could impact success?  
15. How does this initiative position us for future opportunities or challenges?  

## Value Questions
16. What problem are we solving for the business or customer?  
17. How will this initiative change the customer's experience?  

## Context Questions
18. Is this about growth, efficiency, reliability, customer trust, or something else?  
19. How should we balance this against technical debt and operational health?  
20. What data or evidence do we already have to support this direction?  

## How to Use These Questions
- Use these questions during quarterly planning sessions
- Apply them when evaluating new initiatives or projects
- Reference them during 1:1s with team members to ensure alignment
- Include them in [Quarterly Planning Alignment](../communication/07-quarterly-planning-alignment.md) discussions

## Success Metric
These questions help ensure that every engineering initiative can be clearly traced back to business value and strategic goals, creating alignment between technical work and company vision.
