# üéØ Prioritizing Work That Matters Playbook

**Purpose:**  
Ensure the team focuses effort on high-impact initiatives that align with company strategy, customer value, and engineering health. Prioritization is how we say *‚Äúyes‚Äù* to the right things and confidently say *‚Äúno‚Äù* to distractions.

---

## 1. Detect / Identify
- Backlog is overflowing with requests, making it unclear what to focus on.  
- Engineers feel pulled in too many directions.  
- Leadership or stakeholders ask for ‚Äúeverything, now.‚Äù  
- Team output doesn‚Äôt clearly connect to business or customer impact.  

---

## 2. Guiding Principles
- **Impact > Activity**: Busyness ‚â† value.  
- **Strategic Alignment**: Tie work directly to company OKRs or goals.  
- **Balance**: Mix customer value, tech health, and innovation.  
- **Transparency**: Make prioritization criteria explicit to avoid ‚Äúhidden agendas.‚Äù  
- **Adaptability**: Reassess priorities when context changes.

## 3. Act / Execute
### High-Level Process
1. **Define Criteria**  
   - What matters most this quarter? (e.g., revenue, retention, reliability)  
   - Align criteria with leadership and product partners.  

2. **Score & Compare**  
   - Use a prioritization framework (RICE, MoSCoW, Eisenhower Matrix, etc.).  
   - Normalize scores with stakeholders to avoid bias.  

3. **Decide & Communicate**  
   - Select a small set of *top-priority initiatives*.  
   - Clearly communicate *why* these were chosen (and why others were not).  
   - Document decisions in a visible backlog or roadmap.  

4. **Review & Adjust**  
   - Revisit priorities at sprint reviews or quarterly planning.  
   - Adjust as business context changes.  

---

## 4. Prevent Recurrence / Continuous Improvement
- Establish a **quarterly prioritization cycle** with stakeholders.  
- Keep a ‚Äúparking lot‚Äù for lower-priority items (so good ideas aren‚Äôt lost).  
- Review completed work against goals ‚Äî did it deliver the expected impact?  
- Train engineers and leads to connect their work to outcomes, not just tickets.  

---

## 5. Ritual Cadence
- **Weekly:** Align sprint backlog with priorities.  
- **Monthly:** Reassess ‚Äúin progress‚Äù vs. ‚Äúon hold‚Äù items.  
- **Quarterly:** Run a full prioritization workshop using chosen framework(s).

## 6. Example Messages / Templates
**Communicating Priorities (Slack):**  
> ‚ÄúFor Q4, our top 3 initiatives are A, B, and C. These align with company goals around revenue growth and platform stability. Items X and Y are parked for now but will be revisited next cycle.‚Äù  

**Stakeholder Alignment (Email):**  
> ‚ÄúWe scored initiatives using the RICE framework. Based on reach, impact, confidence, and effort, the top priorities are Feature X and Tech Debt Y. This ensures we deliver customer value while strengthening reliability.‚Äù  

---

## Success Metric
Team effort is focused on a small number of high-impact initiatives, stakeholders understand *why* they were prioritized, and engineers see how their work connects to outcomes.
