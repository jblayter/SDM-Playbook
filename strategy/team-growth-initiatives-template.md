# Team Growth Initiatives Template

**Purpose:**  
Map individual team member development goals to technical projects and initiatives, ensuring professional growth is woven into roadmap planning rather than treated as separate overhead.

**Servant Leadership Approach:**  
This template embodies the principle that your role as a manager is to serve your team's growth and development. Every growth initiative should be designed with deep empathy for individual aspirations, learning styles, and personal circumstances.

**Progress Over Process:**  
Focus on creating growth opportunities that matter, not filling out templates. Use this framework to accelerate individual development, not to create bureaucratic overhead. The goal is to help people grow faster and more effectively, not to complete every section of every form.

**Bias for Action:**  
Don't wait for perfect growth plans. Start with simple conversations, make quick decisions about growth opportunities, and iterate based on what works. Most growth decisions are reversible, so take calculated risks and move fast.

## Quick Start: Growth Conversations (15 Minutes)

**Essential Questions to Ask Each Team Member:**
1. "What's one skill you'd love to develop this quarter?"
2. "What project would excite you most right now?"
3. "What support do you need to grow in that area?"
4. "How can I help you succeed?"

**If you have more time, use the detailed frameworks below.**
