# Stakeholder Communication Strategy

**Purpose:**  
Provide tailored communication approaches for different stakeholder types during roadmap planning and execution, ensuring appropriate messaging and engagement for each audience.

**Emotional Intelligence Foundation:**  
This strategy is built on the understanding that effective communication requires deep empathy, emotional awareness, and the ability to connect with each stakeholder's unique concerns, motivations, and communication preferences. Every interaction should serve to build trust, understanding, and collaborative relationships.

## 1. Stakeholder Mapping

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Product Managers:** Direct partners in roadmap planning
- **Engineering Leadership:** Your management chain and peers
- **Design Team:** User experience and interface partners
- **Other Engineering Teams:** Cross-team dependencies and collaboration

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Executive Leadership:** CTO, VP Engineering, CEO
- **Business Stakeholders:** Sales, Marketing, Customer Success
- **Operations Teams:** DevOps, Security, Compliance
- **External Partners:** Vendors, consultants, customers

### Stakeholder Emotional Mapping
For each stakeholder, understand:
- **Primary Concerns:** What keeps them awake at night?
- **Success Metrics:** How do they measure success?
- **Communication Style:** Direct vs. diplomatic, data-driven vs. story-driven
- **Stress Triggers:** What creates anxiety or pressure for them?
- **Motivation Drivers:** What energizes and inspires them?
- **Preferred Timing:** When are they most receptive to different types of communication?

## 2. Communication Templates by Stakeholder

### Product Managers
**Frequency:** Weekly during planning, bi-weekly during execution  
**Format:** Collaborative documents, shared dashboards, regular syncs  
**Key Messages:** Technical feasibility, trade-offs, dependencies, team capacity
**Emotional Intelligence Approach:** 
- **Acknowledge their pressure** to deliver customer value and meet business goals
- **Show empathy** for the complexity of balancing multiple priorities
- **Build partnership** by framing engineering needs as enablers, not obstacles
- **Create psychological safety** for honest conversations about constraints

Subject: Engineering Input for [Quarter] Roadmap Planning

Hi [Product Manager],

I know you're juggling a lot of priorities right now, and I appreciate the time you've taken to work through this roadmap with us. Here's the engineering perspective, framed to help us both succeed:

**Technical Feasibility:**
- [Initiative A]: ✅ Feasible with current team, 6 weeks - This aligns well with your Q3 goals
- [Initiative B]: ⚠️ Requires additional headcount, 12 weeks - I understand this is important to you, let's discuss options
- [Initiative C]: ❌ Not feasible without platform upgrades - I know this is disappointing, here's what we can do instead

**Dependencies & Risks:**
- Cross-team dependency on [Team] for [specific need] - I'm working to minimize this impact
- Technical debt that could impact delivery timeline - I want to be transparent about this risk
- Resource constraints that may require prioritization - Let's work together to find the best path forward

**Recommendations:**
- Prioritize [Initiative A] for quick wins - This gives us both a strong start
- Consider phasing [Initiative B] to manage risk - I'm happy to explore creative approaches
- Defer [Initiative C] until platform work is complete - Here's how we can make this work later

I'm here to support your success. What questions do you have, and how can I help make this roadmap work for both of us?

Next steps: [Specific actions and timeline]
