# 1:1 Meetings Playbook

**Purpose:**  
Build trust, support growth, and create a feedback loop between manager and individual. 1:1s ensure engineers feel heard, supported, and guided — not just on current work, but in their careers and development.


> **Template:** For a ready-to-use 1:1 notes doc, see [1:1 Notes Template](./1-on-1-template.md).


## 1. Detect / Identify
- Every direct report should have a recurring 1:1 (weekly or bi-weekly).  
- Needed ad hoc when stress, conflict, or blockers arise.  
- Crucial during career transitions (new role, promotion, performance concerns).  


## 2. Categorize
| Type                  | Focus Area                          | When to Use |
|--|-|-|
| **Tactical**          | Current sprint, blockers, priorities | Weekly/bi-weekly |
| **Developmental**     | Skills growth, career goals, training | Monthly |
| **Feedback**          | Giving/receiving feedback, reflection | As needed, but at least quarterly |
| **Relationship/Trust**| Personal check-in, team morale       | Every session (at least 5–10 min) |


## 3. Act / Execute
### **1:1 Agenda (30–45 minutes)**
1. **Personal Check-In (5 min)**  
   - *“How are you feeling this week, inside and outside of work?”*  
   - Builds trust and psychological safety.  

2. **Current Work & Blockers (10–15 min)**  
   - Discuss progress, challenges, dependencies.  
   - Look for patterns (recurring blockers, misaligned expectations).  

3. **Career & Growth (10–15 min)**  
   - Review goals, stretch assignments, skill gaps.  
   - Ask: *“Where do you want to grow in the next 6 months?”*  
   - Align opportunities in current roadmap with development goals.  

4. **Feedback Exchange (5–10 min)**  
   - Manager to employee: specific, timely feedback (positive + constructive).  
   - Employee to manager: *“What’s one thing I could do to better support you?”*  
   - Document action items for both sides.  

5. **Wrap-Up (5 min)**  
   - Summarize agreements, next steps.  
   - End on a positive note (recognition, encouragement).  


## 4. Prevent Recurrence / Continuous Improvement
- Keep a **shared 1:1 doc** (Google Doc/Notion) for notes, agenda items, and follow-ups.  
- Track commitments from both sides — accountability builds trust.  
- Regularly rotate agenda focus (not just work updates).  
- Ask quarterly: *“Are these 1:1s useful to you? How can we make them better?”*  


## 5. Ritual Cadence
- **Weekly/Bi-Weekly:** Tactical + trust building.  
- **Monthly:** Development-focused 1:1.  
- **Quarterly:** Structured feedback + career growth session.  
- **Ad Hoc:** Whenever stress, conflict, or urgent issues arise.  


## 6. Example Messages / Templates
**Kickoff (New 1:1 Relationship):**  
> “These 1:1s are your time — I’ll bring topics, but I want to hear what’s most important to you. We’ll cover work, your growth, and feedback. Let’s keep a shared doc so nothing slips through.”  

**Growth Question Prompts:**  
- What part of your work energizes you most right now?  
- What skills do you want to develop in the next 6 months?  
- If you could design your perfect project, what would it look like?  

**Feedback Prompt (Slack/Follow-Up):**  
> “Thanks for today’s 1:1. My takeaway is to unblock you on X, and you’ll try Y experiment next sprint. Let’s check in on progress next week.”  


## Success Metric
Engineers leave 1:1s feeling supported, heard, and clear on next steps. Over time, retention, engagement, and individual growth metrics improve.
