# 🔄 Sprint Retrospectives Playbook

**Purpose:**  
Continuously improve the team’s processes, collaboration, and delivery by reflecting on the previous sprint. Retros give the team a safe space to share what worked, what didn’t, and what to try next.

---

## 1. Detect / Identify
- Held at the end of each sprint or milestone.  
- Needed when morale dips, quality issues rise, or collaboration feels strained.  
- Can be run ad hoc after incidents or major launches.  

---

## 2. Categorize
| Format              | Description                                   | When to Use |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Start/Stop/Continue** | Simple, focuses on immediate habits        | Short sprints, new teams |
| **4Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For)** | Broader reflection | Teams exploring growth and culture |
| **Sailboat**        | Visual: wind (helped), anchors (slowed), rocks (risks), island (goal) | Creative teams or complex projects |
| **Mad/Sad/Glad**    | Emotional check-in, uncover morale issues     | Burnout or conflict risk |

## 3. Act / Execute
### **Retro Agenda (60 minutes)**
1. **Set the Stage (5 min)**  
   - Welcome, explain purpose: *“We’re here to improve how we work, not to assign blame.”*  
   - Establish ground rules (respect, honesty, no interruptions).  

2. **Gather Data (15 min)**  
   - Use sticky notes, digital board, or shared doc.  
   - Prompt: *“What went well? What was challenging? Any surprises?”*  

3. **Generate Insights (15 min)**  
   - Group items into themes.  
   - Discuss root causes (ask “why” 2–3 times).  
   - Encourage balanced discussion — don’t only focus on negatives.  

4. **Decide on Actions (15 min)**  
   - Select 2–3 items to improve next sprint (not a laundry list).  
   - Assign owners, add to backlog, track progress.  

5. **Close the Retro (10 min)**  
   - End with appreciations or “shoutouts.”  
   - Quick confidence vote: *“Do you feel heard today?”*  
   - Thank the team for openness.

## 4. Prevent Recurrence / Continuous Improvement
- Track action items in the sprint backlog and review them at the start of the next retro.  
- Rotate facilitator role to keep things fresh.  
- Experiment with different retro formats to prevent fatigue.  
- Run anonymous pulse surveys if candor seems low.  

---

## 5. Ritual Cadence
- **Every sprint:** Standard retrospective.  
- **After incidents:** Blameless postmortem (can replace retro if timing overlaps).  
- **Quarterly:** Extended retro with a broader scope (team health, process, collaboration).

## Success Metric
👉 Retros consistently produce 2–3 actionable improvements per sprint, and the team sees measurable progress in collaboration, delivery speed, and morale over time.
