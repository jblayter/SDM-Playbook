# Facilitating Collaboration Playbook

**Purpose:**  
Enable effective collaboration within the team and across functions (product, design, stakeholders) by creating structures and habits that make communication clear, decisions faster, and teamwork frictionless.  


## 1. Detect / Identify
- Team silos forming ("that's not my job" mindset).  
- Engineers blocked due to unclear handoffs.  
- Product/design/engineering disagreements slowing delivery.  
- Decisions taking too long or being revisited repeatedly.  


## 2. Categorize
| Category                | Examples                                              | Response Tactic |
|-|-|--|
| **Intra-Team**          | Engineers not sharing context, duplicate work         | Introduce shared docs, pair programming, async updates |
| **Cross-Functional**    | Misaligned priorities between product/engineering     | Co-create roadmaps, use RACI for clarity |
| **Decision-Making**     | Endless debates, unclear owner                        | Assign DRI (Directly Responsible Individual), use decision logs |
| **Information Flow**    | Updates scattered, stakeholders out of the loop       | Establish single source of truth (Slack channel, Confluence page) |


## 3. Act / Execute
- **Set Collaboration Norms**  
  - Define how the team communicates (Slack vs. meetings vs. docs).  
  - Establish "default open" sharing — document decisions and make them visible.  

- **Use Frameworks**  
  - Apply **RACI** or **DACI** to clarify roles in projects.  
  - Create decision logs using [Architecture Decision Record](../communication-templates/06-architecture-decision-record.md) template (what was decided, why, and by whom).  

- **Run Collaboration Rituals**  
  - Kickoff meetings for new projects with clear roles, goals, and timelines.  
  - Joint backlog grooming with product/design.  
  - Regular demos so teams see each other's work in progress.  

- **Foster Trust**  
  - Encourage pairing/peer reviews for shared learning.  
  - Model healthy conflict resolution — disagree in the room, align outside it.  


## 4. Prevent Recurrence / Continuous Improvement
- Review collaboration friction in retrospectives.  
- Rotate facilitators in meetings so collaboration doesn't hinge on one person.  
- Collect anonymous feedback quarterly on "team collaboration health."  
- Sunset rituals that don't add value (keep collaboration lean).  


## 5. Ritual Cadence
- **Daily:** Async standups or Slack threads for visibility.  
- **Weekly:** Joint backlog grooming with product/design.  
- **Bi-Weekly:** Demo day or knowledge-sharing session.  
- **Quarterly:** Collaboration health survey + retro.  


## 6. Example Messages / Templates
**Kickoff Reminder (Slack):**  
> Project kickoff at 10am! We'll align on goals, owners, and next steps. Agenda: 1) Scope, 2) Roles, 3) Risks, 4) Timeline.  

**Decision Log Entry (Confluence):**  
> **Decision:** Adopt database migration tool X.  
> **Date:** Sept 5, 2025  
> **Owner:** Jane (Eng Lead)  
> **Context:** Needed consistent migration across teams.  

**Collaboration Check-In Question (Retro):**  
> On a scale of 1–5, how easy was it to collaborate across roles this sprint?  


## Success Metric
Collaboration feels frictionless: fewer silos, faster decisions, less rework. Measured through retro scores, cross-team feedback, and reduced cycle time for projects.
