# Advocating for Your Team Playbook

**Purpose:**  
Ensure that the team’s needs, accomplishments, and challenges are consistently represented to leadership and stakeholders. Advocacy builds trust, secures resources, and creates psychological safety for engineers to focus on their work.


## 1. Detect / Identify
- Team delivering but not getting recognition.  
- Engineers consistently under pressure due to unrealistic deadlines.  
- Resource needs (headcount, tools, training) not visible to leadership.  
- Decisions made without engineering input that impact delivery.  


## 2. Categorize
| Category               | Examples                                                 | Response Tactic                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recognition**        | Team ships critical features but credit goes elsewhere   | Highlight team wins in all-hands, send kudos to leadership                      |
| **Resourcing**         | Overload due to lack of headcount or tooling             | Build a data-backed case for hiring/tools, escalate needs early                  |
| **Protection**         | Engineers pulled into low-value tasks                    | Redirect work, push back on scope creep, negotiate trade-offs                    |
| **Voice in Decisions** | Roadmaps made without engineering feasibility considered | Ensure engineering participates in planning, speak up on risks                   |


## 3. Act / Execute
- **Champion Accomplishments**  
  - Share demos, shoutouts in Slack, kudos in leadership meetings.  
  - Nominate engineers for recognition programs or awards.  

- **Secure Resources**  
  - Track workload and use metrics (velocity, cycle time, attrition risk) to justify additional headcount or tools.  
  - Frame requests in business terms: *“We can hit X market window if we have Y support.”*  

- **Protect the Team**  
  - Push back respectfully on unrealistic deadlines — propose alternatives.  
  - Redirect “drive-by” requests to product/SDM intake processes.  
  - Ensure work aligns with team goals, not just ad hoc asks.  

- **Amplify Their Voice**  
  - Bring engineers into roadmap discussions.  
  - Echo and reinforce their concerns in leadership forums.  
  - Use decision logs to ensure input is recorded and visible.  


## 4. Prevent Recurrence / Continuous Improvement
- Regularly pulse-check the team: *“Do you feel your work is recognized?”*  
- Build a running list of accomplishments to highlight at quarterly reviews.  
- Proactively gather data on workload and resourcing before crunches hit.  
- Encourage engineers to self-advocate — give them platforms to present directly.  


## 5. Ritual Cadence
- **Weekly:** Share team wins in Slack or status reports.  
- **Bi-Weekly:** Run demos where engineers present to stakeholders.  
- **Monthly:** Raise resource/trade-off issues in leadership meetings.  
- **Quarterly:** Present “Team Impact Summary” at all-hands or exec reviews.  


## 6. Example Messages / Templates
**Recognition (Slack):**  
> Huge shoutout to the team for shipping Feature X ahead of schedule! This unlocks Y revenue opportunity. Great collaboration across the board.  

**Protecting Team Capacity (Email):**  
> Thanks for the request on Z. The team is currently focused on A and B, which are tied to this quarter’s commitments. Happy to slot Z into next sprint planning or discuss trade-offs if it’s critical.  

**Resource Ask (Leadership Sync):**  
> Our current velocity is flat while backlog is growing 20% per sprint. Without an additional engineer in Q4, we risk slipping the release. I propose hiring one FTE or contracting support.  


## Success Metric
The team feels seen, protected, and supported. Their contributions are recognized, requests for resources are met with seriousness, and leadership trusts the team's input in decision-making.
