# What I Need From My Supervisor to Be a Successful SDM

**Purpose:**  
Clarify expectations and support required from my manager to operate effectively as a Software Development Manager. These areas ensure I can focus on enabling my team, aligning with business strategy, and driving impact.

## 1. Clear Direction & Alignment
- **Strategic context:** Clear articulation of company priorities, OKRs, and how my team fits into the bigger picture.  
- **Decision-making guardrails:** When I should escalate vs. when I should own a decision.  
- **Prioritization support:** Alignment on what "matters most" so I can confidently say *no* to lower-value work.  

## 2. Advocacy & Air Cover
- **Executive advocacy:** Promote my team's wins in director/VP forums.  
- **Shielding:** Protect against scope creep, unrealistic deadlines, or organizational churn.  
- **Cross-functional support:** Help me foster alignment with product, design, and other stakeholders when priorities or perspectives differ. 

## 3. Resources & Empowerment
- **Resourcing clarity:** Timely decisions on headcount, budget, and tooling requests.  
- **Access:** Open doors to other leaders/teams for collaboration.  
- **Empowerment:** Create space for me to take ownership and grow as a leader, with guidance when needed and trust in my judgment.  

## 4. Coaching & Feedback
- **Regular feedback:** Specific, actionable input on where I'm excelling and where I need to adjust.  
- **Career growth:** Support for my own development (training, mentorship, exposure to strategic initiatives).  
- **Safe sounding board:** Space to talk through challenges (people issues, strategy questions) without judgment.  

## 5. Transparency & Communication
- **Early signal:** Heads-up as you can on organizational changes or shifting priorities before they cascade down.  
- **Accessible cadence:** Consistent 1:1s with time for my topics, not just status updates.  
- **No surprises:** Share both positive and negative feedback directly and quickly.  

## Success Metric
When these foundations are in place, it creates the space for me to lead effectively, grow as a manager, and help my team consistently deliver meaningful results.
