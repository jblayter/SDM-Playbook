# SDM Playbook

A comprehensive collection of frameworks, templates, and practices for effective Software Development Management.

## About This Playbook

This repository contains practical tools and frameworks I've developed and refined throughout my career. It represents a living, evolving set of practices that focus on enabling teams, aligning with business strategy, and driving meaningful impact.

## My Perspective on the SDM Role

As a Software Development Manager, my role centers on being a **team enabler**, **strategic navigator**, and **growth mentor**. I bring guidance and experience to every conversation, helping teams translate business goals into clear technical direction, grow individually through coaching and feedback, and operate in an environment where collaboration, learning, and celebrating wins are part of the culture.

It's not just about delivering softwareâ€”it's about building up people while building great products.

> *"One of the most meaningful aspects in life is being in service to other human beings."*

At its core, the Software Development Manager role is about service:
- Service to **your team**, by removing blockers, guiding growth, and celebrating wins
- Service to **your peers and partners**, by building alignment and collaboration across product, design, and stakeholders  
- Service to **the organization**, by ensuring engineering effort delivers meaningful impact

## Philosophy

Great software development management is about creating an environment where talented people can do their best work while building products that matter. It's the intersection of technical excellence, people development, and business impact.
