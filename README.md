## What does it mean to be a Software Development Manager

As a Software Development Manager, my role centers on being a team enabler, strategic navigator, and growth mentor. I bring guidance and experience to every conversation, helping the team translate business goals into clear technical direction, grow individually through coaching and feedback, and operate in an environment where collaboration, learning, and celebrating wins are part of the culture. It's not just about delivering software, it's about building up people while building great products.
