# SDM Playbook

## Why Being an SDM Matters

> *"One of the most meaningful aspects in life is being in service to other human beings."*

At its core, the Software Development Manager role is about service.  
- Service to **your team**, by removing blockers, guiding growth, and celebrating wins.  
- Service to **your peers and partners**, by building alignment and collaboration across product, design, and stakeholders.  
- Service to **the organization**, by ensuring engineering effort delivers meaningful impact.  

The "why" of being an SDM isn't just about output or delivery ... it's about enabling people to do their best work, fostering growth, and building trust. When we lead with service, the outcomes naturally follow.

## What does it mean to be a Software Development Manager

As a Software Development Manager, my role centers on being a team enabler, strategic navigator, and growth mentor. I bring guidance and experience to every conversation, helping the team translate business goals into clear technical direction, grow individually through coaching and feedback, and operate in an environment where collaboration, learning, and celebrating wins are part of the culture. It's not just about delivering software, it's about building up people while building great products.

Great software development management is about creating an environment where talented people can do their best work while building products that matter. It's the intersection of technical excellence, people development, and business impact.

# What I Need From My Supervisor to Be a Successful SDM

**Purpose:**  
Clarify expectations and support required from my manager to operate effectively as a Software Development Manager. These areas ensure I can focus on enabling my team, aligning with business strategy, and driving impact.

## 1. Clear Direction & Alignment
- **Strategic context:** Clear articulation of company priorities, OKRs, and how my team fits into the bigger picture.  
- **Decision-making guardrails:** When I should escalate vs. when I should own a decision.  
- **Prioritization support:** Alignment on what "matters most" so I can confidently say *no* to lower-value work.  

## 2. Advocacy & Air Cover
- **Executive advocacy:** Promote my team's wins in director/VP forums.  
- **Shielding:** Protect against scope creep, unrealistic deadlines, or organizational churn.  
- **Cross-functional support:** Reinforce my authority with product, design, or external stakeholders when alignment is tough.  

## 3. Resources & Empowerment
- **Resourcing clarity:** Timely decisions on headcount, budget, and tooling requests.  
- **Access:** Open doors to other leaders/teams for collaboration.  
- **Empowerment:** Create space for me to take ownership and grow as a leader, with guidance when needed and trust in my judgment.  

## 4. Coaching & Feedback
- **Regular feedback:** Specific, actionable input on where I'm excelling and where I need to adjust.  
- **Career growth:** Support for my own development (training, mentorship, exposure to strategic initiatives).  
- **Safe sounding board:** Space to talk through challenges (people issues, strategy questions) without judgment.  

## 5. Transparency & Communication
- **Early signal:** Heads-up on organizational changes or shifting priorities before they cascade down.  
- **Accessible cadence:** Consistent 1:1s with time for my topics, not just status updates.  
- **No surprises:** Share both positive and negative feedback directly and quickly.  

## Success Metric
When these foundations are in place, it creates the space for me to lead effectively, grow as a manager, and help my team consistently deliver meaningful results.
